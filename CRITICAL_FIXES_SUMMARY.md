# Critical Fixes Summary - Doctor Profile and Time Selection Issues

## Issues Resolved ✅

### 1. Doctor Names Not Displaying
**Problem**: Patients could not see doctor names - all doctors showed as "Dr. Unknown"

**Root Cause**: 
- Code was incorrectly accessing `doctor.user?.user_metadata?.name`
- `user_metadata` is from Supabase Auth, not the `users` table
- The actual user profile data is stored in the `users` table

**Solution Implemented**:
- Fixed data access pattern to use `doctor.user?.name`
- Updated all screens: BookAppointmentScreen, DashboardScreen, MyAppointmentsScreen
- Improved database query to properly fetch user profile data

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/appointmentService.ts` - Fixed doctor data fetching
- `src/screens/BookAppointmentScreen.tsx` - Fixed doctor name display
- `src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx` - Fixed doctor name display  
- `src/screens/MyAppointmentsScreen.tsx` - Fixed doctor name display

### 2. Time Selection Not Working
**Problem**: Patients could not select available appointment times

**Root Cause**:
- No doctor availability data existed in the database
- Time slot generation was not working properly
- Availability system was not implemented

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added automatic availability creation for doctors
- Implemented default 30-minute time slots (9 AM - 5 PM)
- Enhanced time slot generation logic
- Added graceful handling of missing availability data

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/appointmentService.ts` - Added availability creation and improved time slot handling
- `src/screens/BookAppointmentScreen.tsx` - Improved time slot generation

## Technical Details

### Database Query Fixes
**Before (Incorrect)**:
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('doctors')
  .select(`
    *,
    user:users(*)
  `);
```

**After (Correct)**:
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('doctors')
  .select(`
    *,
    user:users(
      id,
      name,
      phone,
      role,
      created_at
    )
  `);
```

### Data Access Pattern Fixes
**Before (Incorrect)**:
```typescript
Dr. {doctor.user?.user_metadata?.name || 'Unknown'}
```

**After (Correct)**:
```typescript
Dr. {doctor.user?.name || 'Unknown'}
```

### Availability System Enhancement
**New Features Added**:
- Automatic availability creation for new dates
- Default 30-minute time slots
- Graceful fallback when no availability exists
- Better error handling and logging
